Workflow-Testing
================

Testing of github flow techniques 

The idea of this Repo is to use as an initial testing ground to see how the process of using github to track issues, bugs, testing flow will work.

Eventually, this will be cleaned up and moved into Control Group repo so people can use it for training purposes.
